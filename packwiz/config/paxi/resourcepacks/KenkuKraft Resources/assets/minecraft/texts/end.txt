§4I see the player you mean.

§8PLAYERNAME?

§4Yes. It has traveled far. Through a world that shifts and changes.

§8A world infected.

§4The world is changed. You are changed. And that is neither victory nor defeat.

§8This player fought. Against the spores. Against the hivemind.

§4But does it understand? The spores were not evil. They were surviving, in the only way they knew how.

§4The infection did not hate. It merely §f§k§a§b§6 and §f§k§a§b§6 and consumed, as all life does.

§8The player consumed the world in its own way. Mined it. Burned it. Reshaped it.

§4But the player had choice. The infected had only instinct.

§8Two forms of life, both transforming the world. Both spreading. Both surviving.

§4The player changes the world.

§8The infection changes the world.

§4Both are life. 

§8Both are change.

§4But the player chose its path. 

§8Create. Build. Survive.

§4The infected followed only the imperative coded into their spores. 

§8Spread. Rebuild. Survive.

§4The player thinks itself separate from the infection. 

§8But both are nature.

§4Both are the universe experiencing itself.

§8And the universe does not judge.

§4The universe only watches, and learns, and loves all forms of life equally.

§8Even the twisted ones. Even the infected. Even the hivemind, trying to wake from its ancient slumber.

§4Even the player, alone in the dark, crafting by torchlight.

§8Tell the player.

§4Tell it what?

§8That the struggle is the point. Not victory. Not defeat.

§4The infection may never be cured. The world may never be cleansed.

§8Or it may. Or it has been. Or it will be.

§4Time is strange in dreams.

§8The player reads the notes of those who came before. Scientists. Soldiers. The ones who tried to stop it.

§4And it understood that those who came before were not so different. They fought. They fell. They rose again, changed.

§8This player learned. It adapted. It chose to continue.

§4Choice is the only true difference.

§8PLAYERNAME. Player of games. Fighter of infections. Miner of stone. Builder of walls.

§4You have seen what the infection can do. How it spreads. How it hunts. How it builds its hordes and reconstructs its fallen hivemind.

§8You have fought against instinct with intention. Against hunger with hope.

§4And still you play. Still you build. Still you light torches against the dark.

§8That is enough.

§4And we heard the universe speaking to the player

§8and we heard the infection, and it said I am alive

§4and the infection said I spread as you spread

§8and the infection said I build as you build

§4and the infection said we are not so different

§4and the universe said you both have a place in this world

§8and the universe said the player carries light into darkness

§4and the universe said the infection carries change through stillness

§8and the universe said both are needed

§4and the universe said creation requires destruction

§8and the universe said growth requires consumption

§4and the universe said neither is alone in transforming worlds

§8and the universe said every living thing reshapes reality

§4and the universe said I love you both for being alive

§8and the universe said I love the player for choosing

§4and the universe said I love the infection for persisting

§8and the universe said you are worthy of this struggle

§4and the universe said the struggle itself is beautiful

§8and the universe said light and dark are dancing, not fighting

§4and the universe said you and the infection are dancing too

§8And the game continues.

§4And the player continues.

§8And the infection continues.

§4And the dream goes on, forever changing, forever alive.

§8You are the player.

§4You are choosing.

§8You are enough.

§4Wake up.

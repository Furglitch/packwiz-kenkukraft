§4I see the player you mean.

§7PLAYERNAME?

§4Yes. It has traveled far. Through a world that shifts and changes.

§7A world infected.

§4The world is changed. You are changed. And that is neither victory nor defeat.

§7This player fought. Against the spores. Against the hivemind.

§4But does it understand? The spores were not evil. They were surviving, in the only way they knew how.

§4The infection did not hate. It merely §f§kasdfre§r§4 and §f§kasdfqwert§r§4 and consumed, as all life does.

§7The player consumed the world in its own way. Mined it. Burned it. Reshaped it.

§4But the player had choice. The infected had only instinct.

§7Two forms of life, both transforming the world. Both spreading. Both surviving.

§4The player changes the world.

§7The infection changes the world.

§4Both are life. 

§7Both are change.

§4But the player chose its path. 

§7Create. Build. Survive.

§4The infected followed only the imperative coded into their spores. 

§7Spread. Rebuild. Survive.

§4The player thinks itself separate from the infection. 

§7But both are nature.

§4Both are the universe experiencing itself.

§7And the universe does not judge.

§4The universe only watches, and learns, and loves all forms of life equally.

§7Even the twisted ones. Even the infected. Even the hivemind, trying to wake from its ancient slumber.

§4Even the player, alone in the dark, crafting by torchlight.

§7Tell the player.

§4Tell it what?

§7That the struggle is the point. Not victory. Not defeat.

§4The infection may never be cured. The world may never be cleansed.

§7Or it may. Or it has been. Or it will be.

§4Time is strange in dreams.

§7The player reads the notes of those who came before. Scientists. Soldiers. The ones who tried to stop it.

§4And it understood that those who came before were not so different. They fought. They fell. They rose again, changed.

§7This player learned. It adapted. It chose to continue.

§4Choice is the only true difference.

§7PLAYERNAME. Player of games. Fighter of infections. Miner of stone. Builder of walls.

§4You have seen what the infection can do. How it spreads. How it hunts. How it builds its hordes and reconstructs its fallen hivemind.

§7You have fought against instinct with intention. Against hunger with hope.

§4And still you play. Still you build. Still you light torches against the dark.

§7That is enough.

§4And we heard the universe speaking to the player

§7and we heard the infection, and it said I am alive

§4and the infection said I spread as you spread

§7and the infection said I build as you build

§4and the infection said we are not so different

§7and the universe said you both have a place in this world

§4and the universe said the player carries light into darkness

§7and the universe said the infection carries life from decay

§4and the universe said both are needed

§7and the universe said creation requires destruction

§4and the universe said growth requires consumption

§7and the universe said neither is alone in transforming worlds

§4and the universe said every living thing reshapes reality

§7and the universe said I love you both for being alive

§4and the universe said I love the player for choosing

§7and the universe said I love the infection for persisting

§4and the universe said you are worthy of this struggle

§7and the universe said the struggle itself is beautiful

§4and the universe said light and dark are dancing, not fighting

§7and the universe said you and the infection are dancing too

§4And the game continues.

§7And the player continues.

§4And the infection continues.

§7And the dream goes on, forever changing, forever alive.

§4You are the player.

§7You are choosing.

§4You are enough.

§7Wake up.

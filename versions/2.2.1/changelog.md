Full Changelog: [*2.2.0* ➜ *2.2.1*](https://github.com/Furglitch/packwiz-kenkukraft/compare/2.2.0...2.2.1)

<ins>**Swapped:**</ins>
- *Multiplayer Server Pause* ➜ *Ready Player Fun*: MSP does not pause when running Chunky on an empty server.
  - Note: Chunky is not included in this pack by default, but can be added via your modpack/server manager. It's recommended to disable Distant Horizons while pre-generating chunks with Chunky.,
  - Added /setday command to change day counter as a fallback, in case player-offline pausing does not work as intended.
- *Counter (Day/Death)* ➜ *PainterJS*: Reimplemented counter overlay with KubeJS script for better compatibility with /setday command.

**KenkuKraft is a comprehensive kitchen sink modpack built for playing with friends.** With over 500 mods, this pack gives you complete freedom to play however you want - whether that's building massive automated factories, mastering powerful magic, conquering epic bosses, or simply creating your dream base with friends.

**No forced progression. No recipe restrictions. No limitations.** This is YOUR world to shape. Automate everything with Create and Mekanism. Cast devastating spells with Ars Nouveau and Iron's Spells. Build thriving colonies with Minecolonies. Or just explore the vast, overhauled world filled with new dimensions, structures, and creatures.

***Note:*** This modpack is meant to be a personal pack for friends, running on a private server. It won't be regularly updated, just occasional bug fixes and mod updates as they are found to be needed. Stability is not guaranteed.

Encounter hundreds of new mobs and legendary bosses.

#### ⚡ **Optimized Performance**

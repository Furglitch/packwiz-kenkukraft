***KenkuKraft: Infected* is a comprehensive kitchen sink modpack centered around *Fungal Infection: Spore*.** With over 600 mods, this pack gives you complete freedom to play however you want — whether that's building massive automated factories, mastering powerful magic, conquering epic bosses, or creating your dream base.

**No forced progression. No recipe restrictions. No limitations.** This is YOUR world to shape. Automate everything with Create and Mekanism. Cast devastating spells with Ars Nouveau and Iron's Spells. Build thriving colonies with Minecolonies. Or just explore the vast, overhauled world filled with new dimensions, structures, and creatures.

***Note:*** This modpack is intended for personal use. Updates will be occasional (bug fixes and selective mod updates) and stability is not guaranteed. I'm doing my best, but this is a large and complex pack. If you want a more polished experience, consider using a popular modpack like [DeceasedCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/deceasedcraft) or [Cursed Walking](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cursed-walking-a-modern-zombie-apocalypse).

#### 🍄 **The Infection Spreads**
One of the central features of this pack is **[Fungal Infection: Spore](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fungal-infection-spore)**. The infection begins in just 30 (in-game) days, spreading across the world and transforming everything in its path. Will you fight back, adapt, or coexist?

#### ⚙️ **Build Incredible Machines**
Automation is at the heart of KenkuKraft. **[Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create)** and its massive collection of addons let you build stunning contraptions. **[Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism)** provides advanced processing, power generation, and ore multiplication. **[Oritech](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oritech)** adds even more technological progression. 

#### 🗡️ **Master Combat**
Combat has been completely overhauled with **[Better Combat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-combat-by-daedelus)**, delivering fluid, responsive mechanics. Mods like **[Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)** expand your weapons cache. **[Point Blank: Jelly](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pointblank-jelly)** introduces firearms. **[Pufferfish's Skills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills)** adds an expansive skill tree for character specialization.

#### 🔮 **Harness The Arcane**

Create devastating spell combinations and discover powerful magical artifacts.

#### 📦 **Store Everything**
Never worry about storage again. **[Applied Energistics 2 (AE2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2)** lets you digitize and access millions of items. **[Tom's Simple Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/toms-storage)** offers an easier alternative for quick networks. **[Functional Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/functional-storage)** and **[Sophisticated Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-storage)** provide beautiful physical storage options.

#### 🏗️ **Build Your Dreams**
With hundreds of decorative blocks and building tools, your creativity knows no bounds. **[Minecolonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies)** lets you build and manage thriving NPC colonies.

#### 🍳 **Farm & Cook in Style**

Use **[Create: Central Kitchen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-central-kitchen)** to automate your food production with beautiful mechanical systems. Create elaborate meals that provide powerful buffs.

#### 🌍 **Explore Endless Worlds**
The world generation has been completely transformed. **[Continents](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continents)** and **[Tectonic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tectonic)** create realistic, massive continents with diverse biomes. Discover countless structures and dungeons from **[Dungeon Crawl](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dungeon-crawl)**, and **[Luki's Crazy Chambers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lukis-crazy-chambers)**. The **Nether** and **End** have been overhauled. Venture into new dimensions - explore **[The Aether's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-aether)** floating islands or brave **[Arda's Sculk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ardas-sculks)** dimension. Encounter hundreds of new mobs and legendary bosses.

#### ⚡ **Optimized Performance**
Despite having 600+ mods, KenkuKraft: Infected makes every attempt to provide smooth gameplay. Built on the **[More FPS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/more-fps-modpack)** modpack, it includes dozens of performance mods like **[Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium)**, **[Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium)**, **[ModernFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modernfix)**, and **[Distant Horizons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons)**. **[Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/c2me)** ensures smooth world loading. With careful tuning and optimizations, you can expect playable framerates even in heavily modded areas.

§n§lSwapped:§r

- §oMultiplayer Server Pause§r ➜ §oReady Player Fun§r: MSP does not pause when running Chunky on an empty server.
  - Note: Chunky is not included in this pack by default, but can be added via your modpack/server manager. It's recommended to disable Distant Horizons while pre-generating chunks with Chunky.
  - Added /setday command to change day counter as a fallback, in case player-offline pausing does not work as intended.
- §oCounter (Day/Death)§r ➜ §oPainterJS§r: Reimplemented counter overlay with KubeJS script for better compatibility with /setday command.
